This project uses Passport for authentication, it will store passwords in a MongoDB databaseâ€”plain text before adding crypto and cryptograph after utilizing crypto. Views are made with the popular templating language `ejs`.
The routes are not protected. This is above the scope of this project as it will require a token session. You can look at this [project](https://github.com/hannydevelop/SCAMP-Assesment) it works on protecting routes with JWT.
